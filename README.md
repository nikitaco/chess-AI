# chess-AI 
A simple but smart chess AI using HTML, Javascript, JQuery, and CSS.
Not too heavy on the HTML but to understand the code a substancial Javascript and JQuery knowledge is required.
All the code is in the file index.html.
I made it this way to reduce confusion about file referencing. 

# UI
download then run index.html.
the board will look like this:

When you hover on a piece, all the squares that the piece can legally move to are colored grey. When you pick up a piece and start moving it, the starting square and the square the piece is currently on are highlighted in a gold color 

The computer will then play it's move.
